This project is one of my first ever made. I created an implementation of machine learning algorithm called k-means algorithm. The idea behind this algorithm is to give it a set of objects that are needed to be clustered, but you don't want to sort it on your own. You just want to give a set of points and number of clusters to be created. Algorithm is making rest of the job. It automatically clusters some closiest points and then proceeds to self-optimize. after x times, when there where changes in objects belonging to clusters it returns a list of objects and a number of cluster it belong.
